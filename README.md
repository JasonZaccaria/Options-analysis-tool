# Options-analysis-tool
Here I am using python's flask framework, along with javascript and chartjs to create a website that allows users to view the expected move for any ticker that contains options. The website prints out both a graph of their probabilty cone as well as a table so users can copy and paste to an excel sheet if they wish to save that snapshot of data. The templating is all done with html, css and jinja. Currently working on a big redesign to implement asynchronous javascript so we will have live time data on screen. With this next update I will also be able to introduce live charting for stocks which will be the next main view.
